# Week 1 
Take some time to Self-reflect on what areas of your life you would improve if you could and write them down. Try to think of a blindspot or weakness you were previously unaware of. 

# Week 2
Download and complete the spreadsheet.

# Week 3
You have already written your self-assesment on where you currently are, and you have started to take stock of all of the noise in your life. Next what we want to do is begin to write down all the things you want to do in and with your life. Really write down all of your aspirations and dreams. Be big, bold and broad, you can focus on details later. 

- Write down all of your goals and dreams you can think of. 
- Make a list of things you would like to do, places to see, books to read etc.
- Write a mission and vision statement for you and or your family if you have one.

# Week 4
Pick one project on your to do list that you could acomplish this week and do it. 

# Week 5
Pick 3 of your goals and for each goal, you should associate at least one regular habit or exercise. Think about the identity goals discussed above. Use the habit formulas to create plans for each of your chosen habits. Pick at least one goal and habit to begin to practice this week. Use some method to track you habit. You can use a pen and paper, a spreadsheet, or an habit tracking app. I like the app Habit Share app. You can download [Habit Share here](https://habitshareapp.com)

# Week 6
In Huberman's video the statistic of "30 days" was cited as the average amount of time that the brain takes to reset reward pathways. Key word there is average, so results may vary. You may take less time, or you may take more time. Think of the most mild bad habit you can think of, that you wish to quit and commit to at least a 4 week fast of that thing. Keep a log of any relapses and try to keep to the rule of "never two". That is if you slip up once, don't allow yourself to slip twice in a row.

# Week 7 
Clean your room and see what happens. 

# Week 8
Think of someone you may have had a falling out with. Think about what may have caused the falling out. Consider reaching out to that person and apologizing for whatever part you may have had in the end of that relationship.
