Virtue, from their word vir, meaning ‘man’, the Romans derived the noun virtus to denote the sum of excellent qualities of men, including Physical Strength, Valorous Conduct and Moral Rectitude.  Cicero wrote of four moral excellences (virtues) that had been previously espoused by Plato and Aristotle, namely “virtutes continentiae, gravitates, justitiae, fidei” (the virtues of temperance, prudence, justice, fortitude).

To be virtuous was to embody classical masculinity.  The modern definition of virtue, much like the modern male of today, no longer seems to reflect such noble ideas.  Project Virtue seeks to revitalize that classic definition and enable men to do those great and noble things for which God hath made them.
