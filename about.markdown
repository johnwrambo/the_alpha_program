The Alpha Program is ten-week program designed to help you figure out your life. Help you self-reflect on where you are, where you want to go, and then to help get a start in the right direction. 

I first conceieved a self help program for young men, and men who are trying to improve thier lives. I did not know at the time what I wanted to call this program. when I shared the idea with some friends I expressed my idea, thinking of the different phases of software development, I referred to it casually as something of an alpha program, and that name stuck. So it was not originally intended to refer to the idea of an alpha male, although I don't dislike that connotation, it more specifically refers to the nature of something in an intial stage. 

As you go through the program, I want you to rememeber, the very thing that we are primarily working on building will be your character. Back to the software analogy, those codes, or governing priniciples for how you lead your life. I believe that if we first work on fixing your character, who you are, then the problems solve themselves. I want you to stop seeing yourself as a victim, and start to take responsiblity for your life. To live your life deliberatly. To beging to plan and think about your life, you year, month, day and hours. To live with purpose, as an active agent, and not to have life just happen to you, constantly simply reacting, but rather proactively. 

You will get out of this program what you put into it. There is reading, and homework. Do them or don't do them. The ideas we will share and discuss are not my own, rather they are ancient. However I hope to have collected, currated and presented them in a logical,constructive and digestible manner that you will find beneficial.


I hope to help a generation of men, who like myself, lacked proper masculine guidance, leadership and teachings. 

Virtue, from their word vir, meaning ‘man’, the Romans derived the noun virtus to denote the sum of excellent qualities of men, including Physical Strength, Valorous Conduct and Moral Rectitude.  Cicero wrote of four moral excellences (virtues) that had been previously espoused by Plato and Aristotle, namely “virtutes continentiae, gravitates, justitiae, fidei” (the virtues of temperance, prudence, justice, fortitude).

-The Merriam Webster New Book of Word Histories, 1991
 
To be virtuous was to embody classical masculinity.  The modern definition of virtue, much like the modern male of today, no longer seems to reflect such noble ideas.  The Alpha Program seeks help men take responsibility for thier own lives and to live a life of virtue.
