This page is to share with you everything I have learned about health and fitness as well as resources and all of the supplements and equipement that I use. 

**The basics**

When most people talk about getting healthy or in shape I think most people are usually primarily concerned with the end result of looking and also hopefully feeling better. Most people may not realize that improving health and fitness will indeed make them feel better as well as imporve areas of thier lives they may have yet to consider.

The fact that more Americans are out of shape and obese than ever means that the case for fitness still has either to be properly made, has yet to reach the masses, or people just don't care. So I will attempt to make a brief, but concerted effort to make the case, for why you want to be healthy, and get in as great as shape as possible.

So why should you get in shape? Other than the most superficial, but usually most motivating, reason of looking better, 







**Equipment**

Calipers – These are a simple, yet effective tool for measuring body fat. Calipers are not the more accurate, but if you are careful and consitent with measurements, they can be fairly precise, and this is most important when tracking fat loss, which is difference in overall body fat, not necccesarily what your overal total body fat composition is.

Garmin Instinct Watch – This is a good starter watch for capturing biometrics. This was my first smart watch for capturing biodata. Used in conjunction with a heart rate strap it provides good biometric data at a entry level price. It should be noted that I never rely on a watch alone for accurate heart rate data. For accurate heart rate data its well worth the investment to get a strap to go along with a watch. So why get a watch in the first place? It's of course a personal preference, but at the very least, the watch allows me to monitor my heart rate in real time. This is useful for not only having a grounded view of actual effort, but it also helps build an intuition for what each range of cariovascular effort feels like, ie what 150 bpm feels like.

Garmin fenix 6X Sapphire  Watch – This is my current watch that I use. I upgraded from the instinct because I liked the more professional look the color display and the higher number of fitness metrics it records.

Garmin HRM-Dual Heart Rate Monitor – Getting back to chest starts, this was my first heart rate monitor, and it still works well, a downside to this, is it requires an active connection to the a smart watch in order to function. There are some other differences between

Garmin HRM-Pro Plus, Premium Chest Strap Heart Rate Monitor – This is my current heart rate monitor, it collects more data. Compare straps here https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/770963#additional

Garmin Index S2, Smart Scale– This really is a luxury item- you don’t need it, any ordinary scale will do, but this scale really reduces the friction in recording my weight, because it is done automatically. I weigh myself, and it automatically syncs my weight data to my Garmin connect app.

Any food scale

Measuring Tape – Use this to measure various body dimensions.

Gym Reaper Knee sleeves – I religiously wear these. I feel naked and cannot go to the gym without them.

Gymreapers Quick Locking Weightlifting -  A must for me whenever I am squatting or deadlifting.

Summary,

Remember these are just the items that I have found useful, that you also might find useful yourself. 

Essential items for a weight loss training program:
•	Calipers
•	Tape measure
•	Any Scale for weighing yourself

The heart rate monitor or heart rate monitor and watch combination is not necessary but I really find a tremendous benefit in understanding my heart rate during exercise as it allows me to track my intensity over time. It also better allows me to quantify exactly how a cardio session went. Additionally, what I have found is that a watch alone is just not a reliable mechanism for providing consistent and accurate heart rate information and thus a chest strap is the best tool for providing accurate heart rate data. 


**Resources**

Calorie Tracking Apps – I do not use this app all the time, only when I am seriously cutting, however it is very useful when tracking your caloric intake. As I mentioned before, create a rule for yourself that you wont eat anything that isn’t tracked.

Online body fat calculator – This is the calculator that I use in conjunction with the calipers listed above to give me my body fat. Remember that these calculators are only so accurate, but so long as you are consistent in measuring, it should yield fairly accurate information as how your overall body fat it changing over time.

Blood Work
I wish I got my blood work done in my early twenties. I had no idea what any of my levels looked liked, what my testosterone, estrogen or growth hormone levels are. It wasnt until I turned thirty that I began to get them checked. You can always request bloolwork from your doctor and ask for whatever you want tested, but some insurances companies limit how often you can get them checked. 

**Supplements and Protien**

Over the course of my lifetime and fitness journey I have countless dolloar on countless supplements. In my experience and according to many other fitness and health experts, these three supplements are the most proven effective supplements. 

Gold Standard Whey

First a note of why protein in important and how it works. Proteins are made of amino acids, which are like building blocks for your body. They're crucial for building and repairing tissues, including muscles, especially after exercise. When you exercise, your muscles experience tiny tears. Protein helps repair these tears, which is how muscles grow stronger and larger.

Taste. In my opinion, taste is thee most important factor when considering what protien you are going to add to your diet, because if you don't like it, odds are you wont even end up drinking it, no matter how "good" it is otherwise. 

I like Gold Standard whey by optimum nutrition, I have been taking it for over ten years. When shopping for protien there are a few things I like to consider other than taste. Taste being equal, I look at how much protein I am getting, that is total weight of protien, not the total weight of the product, just the weight of the protien, per dollar. Think, how many grams of protien per dolloar, or you could think of it the other way, how many dollars per gram. 

So don't mind the total weight on the front. The number you are looking for is the grams per serving. In this case it's 24 grams.Now find the number of servings, in this case it's 74. Now multiply 24x74, that gives you 1776, A perfect number if you ask me. Now take 1776 and divide by the price of the unit, in this case its $79.35. This give us a score of 22.38 grams/dollar. The higher the number the better. Like I said, you could also go the opposite route, and in that case, you of course want a smaller number. This now gives you a good bench mark to compare protein in terms of it's value. The other factors to look for are going to be protien type, quality of protien, and, what you might call caloric cost, if you are concerned with calories at least. Take the number of calories in a serving, and divide them by the grams of protein in a serving. In this case, we have 120/24. We get 5 calories for each gram of protien. This is a pretty good ratio, egg whites, one of the best sources of protein scores about 4.6 protein calories. The same method that we applied to evaluating this protein can also be used to any food in fact, and you can trade out any of the values you wish, depending on which trait you wish to optimize for.

L-Citruline Malate

The key benefit of L-Citrulline Malate is its ability to increase blood flow. This happens because L-Citrulline boosts nitric oxide production in the body, which helps dilate or widen blood vessels, allowing for improved blood flow. Better blood flow means more oxygen and nutrients are delivered to your muscles during exercise. This enhanced oxygen delivery can lead to increased work capacity, allowing muscles to perform better and for longer periods. Additionally, with improved blood circulation, there's potentially more efficient removal of waste products like lactic acid from the muscles, which can aid in recovery. The overall effect is a potential increase in exercise performance and calorie burning.

Creatine Monohydrate

Creatine is vital in the regeneration of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the primary energy source needed for muscle contractions. During intense exercise, when an athlete depletes their immediate ATP stores, the presence of supplemented creatine in their system aids in the rapid regeneration of ATP. This process helps replace depleted ATP stores, allowing the athlete to maintain a higher level of performance during short bursts of high-intensity exercise.
