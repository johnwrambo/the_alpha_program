# Procrastination

**We are all gonna die**

I once dreamt of a reality where I no longer existed. Floating above, I witnessed my own family shattered by my absence. There they were, crushed, in utter disbelief that I was gone. My heart broke. Who would guide my son through life now? The stark finality of my own mortality weighed heavily upon me; I had crossed the river, embarked on that last, forever journey—death.

I pleaded with God, begging for just one more chance, to hold my family once again. However I was all too aware of the impossible nature  of my request; I was dead after all. But just as I began to reconcile with this unbearable truth, I awoke. Alive and sobbing, in my own bed, next to my beloved and very much living wife.

Eagerly, I wrapped my arms around my family, pressing my lips against their foreheads, overwhelmed with gratitude. My desperate prayers, it seemed, had been answered. I was dead, and now I was alive again. 

In my dream a prayed for life, and I awoke alive. How can I say that this dream was not real? 

We will all die someday, the final deadline. As we all continue to consider the goals we wish to acomplish and the changes we wish to make, let us be reminded that we do not have forever to acomplish them, our time is quite short. 

So let's all remember that our lives our short, and everyday that we wake up is our second chance to do more and to do better. Let us not waste it.
