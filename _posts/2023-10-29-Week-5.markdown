# Procrastination

**We are all gonna die**

I once dreamt of a reality where I no longer existed. Floating above, I witnessed my own family shattered by my absence. There they were, crushed, in utter disbelief that I was gone. My heart broke. Who would guide my son through life now? The stark finality of my own mortality weighed heavily upon me; I had crossed the river, embarked on that last, forever journey—death.

I pleaded with God, begging for just one more chance, to hold my family once again. However I was all too aware of the impossible nature  of my request; I was dead after all. But just as I began to reconcile with this unbearable truth, I awoke. Alive and sobbing, in my own bed, next to my beloved and very much living wife.

Eagerly, I wrapped my arms around my family, pressing my lips against their foreheads, overwhelmed with gratitude. My desperate prayers, it seemed, had been answered. I was dead, and now I was alive again. 

In my dream a prayed for life, and I awoke alive. How can I say that this dream was not real? 

We will all die someday, the final deadline. As we all continue to consider the goals we wish to acomplish and the changes we wish to make, let us be reminded that we do not have forever to acomplish them, our time is quite short. 

So let's all remember that our lives our short, and everyday that we wake up is our second chance to do more and to do better. Let us not waste it. 

Procrastination Reflection:

Why are goals, goals? Because they are things we have yet to achieve. And while the reasons for lack of achievement might be many, I think it's fair to say that the reasons that most goals remain goals has to do with not starting in the first place. So why do goals remain goals and not achievments, what are reasons why we don't start. 

Limbic friction, is a termed coined by Andrew Huberman which is a short-hand way to describe the impedance to action. More specifically the resistance brought two different states. The first state being anxiety which prevents you from performing a particular activity. The second state is that where you are feeling generally lazy and unmotivated. I like this term because it describes something that is very important to be aware of when trying to move towards any objective or goal. 

Imagine water flowing. Water always follows the path of least resistance. Us humans are naturally not too different. We are naturally lazy and generally tend to follow this same pattern. Now that we have set our goals, we next need to analyze ourselves and determine where our limbic friction lies.

Think about one of your goals, think about the habits you are trying to develop. Perhaps it’s going to the gym more. Try to think of as many sources of resistance to a particular goal or habit that you have. Be it mental objections, such as, “I can’t go to the gym without caffeine”, or “I don’t even know what I am going to do at the gym anyways”, or even physical barriers such as the gym being an inconvenient distance from your house.
Try to think of as many of these objections, excuses, or obstructions as possible and write them down for each goal and associated habit. For every excuse, write down a solution to overcome this excuse. 

What is the goal? 
What are the habits?
What are my objections?
What are the solutions?


# Discussion
What do you think of the life calendar? Does this help you think about mortality in a new way? How? What long term goal in your life do you have that you keep putting off?
