# Self-assessment Part II

**Overview**
For the following, write down all of your findings. in your note taking platform of your choice, and use spreadsheets where applicable. 

**Finances** <br>
Where does your money go? 
- What are your total monthly expenses? 
    - Itemize all your fixed reoccurring bills and expenses. 
    - How much money do you spend on average, per month, on gas, groceries?
    - List out all your debts, and monthly payments. 

For everything it’s a good idea to list out when payments are made or due, and what accounts they are being drawn from.<br>

**Health and Fitness**<br>
How healthy and fit are you?
There are many metrics for measuring health, and any one by themselves will not give you the complete picture. If you know excessive body fat is your primary issue, weighing yourself is completely appropriate and should be done 2-3 times a day for at least a week to give you a good idea of how your body can fluctuate. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking you have lost or gained weight because you weighed yourself at your heaviest of the day, and your lightest of the day. <br>
<br>
Try this PFT 
- Run 1 mile
- Max pushups to failure
- Max situps to failure
- Max pull ups to failure 
Personal Relationships
How are your relationships?
Go through your contact list and see how many people you have lost contact with. Think about why? Perhaps reach out to someone you have not communicated with in over a year to check in. Maybe there is a reason why communication ceased. 
<br>

**Goal Setting** <br>
Do you think ahead?
Have you ever set a goal before? Have you ever set a goal and achieved it? (something of some level of reasonable difficulty or effort) <br> <br>
**Time management** <br>
How much time do you waste? 
Every time you do something this week that you know to be a waste of time, write down how much time you spent doing that thing, estimate or guess if you have to, or note each time you were distracted by something pointless. 
<br>

**Faith** <br>
What do you believe? Do you know what you believe and why? If you lack a solid belief structure and foundation - something that anchors all of your motivation and action, you will be more susceptible to drift. The 12 Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous famously includes as it's second step, "believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity." You should know what you believe and why. God is a powerful help in achieving any kind of self-control and self-improvement. 

# Discussion Question: 
Discuss the previous weeks homework concerning self-reflection and your attempt to discover new about yourself. Did you find out anything new? Review the exercise for the week and discuss.
